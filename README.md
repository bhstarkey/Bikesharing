# NYC Citi Bike

## Overview

In order to help convince investors to invest in a bikesharing business in Des Moines, we analyzed bikesharing data from Citi Bike in NYC. This would help give investors and business leaders an idea of how a bikesharing business would preform in another location.

We created a [Tableau story](https://public.tableau.com/shared/YQ5RZWD3D?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) to help visualize the data.

## Results

The Citi Bike data was very helpful in giving our potenital bikesharing business a glimpse at what we might see in Des Moines.

The length of checkout for bikes was usually under 20 minutes, but there were some rentals that went longer than that.

But they both saw similar high and low times in rentals.

The most popular start and stop locations were very similar, indicating most rides were not very far.

Because most rides were not very far, the bikes in the most popular areas were the ones who saw the most use, much more than those not in those areas.


### Summary
 
While the Citi Bike data did offer a lot of helpful insights into the bikesharing business, New York City is very different from Des Moines. Visualizations such as the population against the number of rides in the most popular areas would help translate the data to Des Moines better. You could also plot the biggest tourist attractions, any schools and businesses in the area to help understand why people are renting bikes, and what could help our business in Des Moines.
